# LongestCommonSubsequence
This C++ code calculates the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between two input strings using dynamic programming and backtracking. A longest common subsequence (LCS) is the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two sequences).

### Usage

To run the program, provide exactly two strings as command-line arguments:

```
./LevenshteinDistance <string1> <string2>
```

### Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:

```
./LevenshteinDistance abcdefgh xyzefg
```

Output:

```
efg
```
